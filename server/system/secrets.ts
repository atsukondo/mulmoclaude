// `~/.mulmoclaude/secrets/<KEY>`, one file per key, 0600 (#871). NOT under
// `~/mulmoclaude`: that workspace is the agent's data space — "the workspace
// is the database" — and a credential there is readable by everything the
// agent does. Not `.env` in a launch directory either, which is the thing
// this exists to replace: an icon launch has no launch directory, so the
// documented way to supply a key asked the user to find a place that does
// not exist (#2626).
//
// The stored value is applied to `process.env` at boot rather than read at
// use time, because the server is not the only consumer: the agent shells
// out to `mulmocast` for audio and video, and a child process receives a
// key exactly one way — through the environment it inherits. Reading the
// file only where the server calls Gemini would make image generation work
// and video generation fail, which is a worse bug than the one being fixed.
