// `manageShapeScript` — the user's ShapeScript models in the public gallery on
// mulmoserver (server.mulmocast.com/shapes): publish, update, delete, get, getList.
//
// A pure MCP tool like `exportShapeScriptUsdz`: no View, the answer is a URL
// or, for the two reads, JSON. Everything a model sees — schema, description,
// the document a post is, the keyword rules — lives in
// `@gui-chat-plugin/shapescript`, and that entry is Firebase-free on
// purpose. What this host contributes is the signed-in session: the
// remote-host runner signs into mulmoserver's Firebase AS THE USER
// (docs/remote-host.md, "Option B"), so a post is a plain Firestore write on
// `shapes/{id}` that the gallery's rules accept because `uid == request.auth.uid`,
// and the reads are the queries the gallery's own pages run. No session → the
// tool says how to connect one.
//
// The thumbnail comes from the same renderer `renderShapeScript` uses; a host
// without Chromium posts without a picture rather than failing. The script
// itself is a Storage object too (receptron/mulmoserver#266): the document
// carries its id, never the text — so `get` downloads it from under its owner.
