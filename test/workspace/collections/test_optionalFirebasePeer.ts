// `firebase` is an OPTIONAL peer of `@mulmoclaude/core` — so every entry that
// does not need Firestore has to LOAD without it, under `import` and under
// `require` alike (#3263).
//
// Why a child process with a resolution hook, rather than reading the source:
// the invariant was already WRITTEN in `collection/server/index.ts`, and it was
// broken seven lines below the sentence stating it. Nothing that reads the tree
// notices — `typecheck` passes because types erase, and this repository's own
// tests pass because this repository installs firebase. The only check that
// bites is loading the built entry with the package made unresolvable, which is
// exactly what a consumer without it does. `@receptron/sharedapp` is one: a
// pure projection library with no I/O and no Firestore, where core 5 failed at
// load with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.
//
// One import took down six entries, not the one reported, so this sweeps the
// whole exports map rather than naming the entry that happened to be noticed.
// A new entry is covered the day it is declared.
//
// This runs against `packages/core/dist`, the artifact that ships — CI builds
// the workspace packages before the test step, so what it reads there is this
// commit. Run by hand on a tree whose `dist` predates your edit, it answers for
// the OLD build and says so nowhere: `yarn build:packages` first. A missing
// `dist` fails loudly, which is the case worth having loud; a stale one cannot
// be told apart from a fresh one by reading it.
