// Unit tests for the delete guard (#3234).
//
// This is the whole safety of propagating a local deletion, so it is tested in
// both directions: what it lets through, and — the side that matters — what it
// refuses. `events.delete` removes the event for everyone it was sent to, and
// Google's own Trash is the only way back, so a guard that let one attendee
// slip through would take an invitation off other people's calendars.
