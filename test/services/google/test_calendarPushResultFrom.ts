// Which report list each thing a push produced ends up in (#3272).
//
// The result's `skipped` means "this push did not do what you asked". A deletion
// Google refused is not that: the record went away here, the event is
// deliberately still standing there, and the rest of the run carried. While the
// two shared one list, a single refusal took the caller's problem branch with it
// and hid every create and update the same push had made.
//
// Driven through the assembler the push actually uses — it is pure, so there is
// nothing to stub — rather than through a helper beside it. A test of a helper
// leaves the assembler free to merge the lists back together.
