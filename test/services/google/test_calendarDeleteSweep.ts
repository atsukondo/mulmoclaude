// Unit tests for propagating local deletions to Google (#3234).
//
// The guard itself lives in `test_calendarDeletePlan.ts`; this is the
// orchestration around it, and the two things it must get right are both
// about the BASELINE:
//
//   - a deletion that carried must drop its baseline entry, or the same
//     deletion is reported on every run forever;
//   - a deletion that was REFUSED must keep it, because the event is still
//     there and the report is the only thing that says so.
//
// Both are checked here rather than only in a live run, because the live suite
// needs a grant and a disposable calendar and so does not gate a PR.
