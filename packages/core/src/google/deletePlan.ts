// Whether a record deleted in the collection may be deleted in Google (#3234).
//
// The push has always REPORTED a local deletion and left Google alone, because
// `events.delete` removes the event for everyone it was sent to and cannot be
// undone from here. A calendar whose collection is the primary copy needs the
// deletion to carry, though — otherwise the next pull brings the record back
// and the user deletes it again, forever.
//
// So propagation is opt-in per collection, and even then it stops at an event
// with attendees: deleting one of those withdraws it from other people's
// calendars, which is a different act from tidying your own. That guard is
// here, pure, because it is the whole safety of the feature — and it answers
// from what Google currently holds, never from the record, which by then is
// gone.
//
// Pure: no I/O, no clock, no locale.
